## COMP2200 Portfolio 4

### Task background
This dataset is designed to facilitate the development of predictive models for attendants' obesity. This portfolio part will mainly cluster to find groups within data and perform linear regression on some variables within the groups to determine the outcome of people's weight, indicating whether a person is likely to suffer from obesity.

### Table of contents:
- Clean and preprocess the dataset
- Cluster
- Result visualization

### Installation
```
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate dev
```

### Usage
- Cluster
- "Weightd" prediction target. The remaining attributes are predictors
- Build logistic regression models, KNN models and RFE to help with analysis
